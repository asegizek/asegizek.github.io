<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>So far we have made a serial and a parallel implementation of one particular hexagonal cellular automata. The automata is fairly simple, each cell has two states: alive and dead and the rules are as follows: any dead cell can become alive if there are exactly 2 live cells near it, and any live cell continues to be alive if there are 3 or 4 live cells near it. Testing this automata we have achieved around a 55x speedup with our cuda implementation as compared to our serial implementation for a 1000 by 1000 grid with 1000+ iterations. We have also created a simple code skeleton for displaying the cells on the computer but have yet to connect the two modules together. </p>
<p>With regards to our deliverables we are behind schedule and are thinking of perhaps narrowing our framework to work on a few set of cellular automata.




At the poster session we still plan to show both a graph of our implementation and a real live demo displaying the cellular automata in action.


Our main concern is figuring out if our implementation is fast enough since we do not have a good reference to compare it to besides a simple serial implementation. We are also deliberating whether or not we should still continue with a general framework approach or narrowing it down to a few types of cellular automata.</p>
